	<p>Emperor penguins spend their entire lives on Antarctic ice and in its waters. The birds are not able to fly yet they are incredible swimmers. They are capable of diving to the depts of 150-250 metres. An average dive lasts about 3-6 minutes. Their diet consist mainly of fish such as the Antarctic silverfish and Antarctic krill.Their preys are small preys due to the fact that they would be easier to bring to body temperature so that they can be digested. An adult penguin eats about 2-3 kg per day. They will need to store as much fat as they can before breeding season.</p>

	<h2>Breeding</h2>

	<p>Emperor penguins are the only animals that breed during the Antarctic winter. They are not physically designed to survive the winter conditions but they developed social behaviors to help him survive the extreme conditions. They would cuddle to store heat and keep each other warm. The penguins would begin their breading cycle in April when the sea ice has reformed and thickened enough to support the colony of penguins. They would either search for their previous mate or find a new one if they haven't bred before. They would need to sing and perform to impress a potential mate. A couple will produce a single egg. The female will produce the egg and transfer the egg to their mate such that they would incubate the egg as the females return to the sea to gather food. The males will have to fast for four months as well as survive the long winter.

	<p>The egg would usually hatch within 65-75 days. By the time the females return, it will be in July. The males will have lost nearly half their body mass while the females will be plump with food. The mates will recognize each other through their calls and will then go through the process of transfering the baby chick back to the female. The males will then head back to the sea to hunt for food. The chicks will have to rely on its parents for body heat until it can regulate their own body temperature. By September, the chicks will have a nice cover of fat and are developing quickly. The chicks will form a huddle to keep each other warm, especially at night. By early December, the chicks will be as big as their parents and they will begin to shed their fur and develop feathers. They will then be able to head out to the open sea on their own.</p>
