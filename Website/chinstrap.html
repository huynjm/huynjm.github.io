	<p> The chinstrap penguin is a species that lives on the surrounding islands of Antarctica, such as the South Sandwich Islands, South Orkenys, South Shetland, South Georgia, Bouvet Island, Balleny and Peter Island. The penguin earned its name by it's appearance, it has a line that rounds under its chin which allows it have an appearance that it's wearing a black helmet. The penguin lives and breeds in large colonies and they often live on large icebergs. Their main prey is krill but they can feed off of small fish and crustaceans This species likes to fight other penguins. The penguins migrate north during the winter and stay at sea until next spring.</p>

	<p>The penguins make a round nest out of stones and pebbles. The females usually lay two eggs in November and the parents would take turns incubating the egg. They would alternate such that one would be able to go hunt for food while the other keeps the egg warm. The eggs hatch after about 15 to 33 days. The chicks stay in the nest for about 20-30 days. Around this time, they should have developed feathers to keep themselves warm. For further warmth, they will form groups with other baby penguins and huddle.</p>
