	<p>The little penguin is the smallest penguin in the world. It is also known as the fairy penguin. They can be found on the rocky coasts of Australia, New Zealand and Chile. The penguins are endangered due to their lost of habitats due to human interference and introduction to newer species. The penguins aren't the typical colours of black and white, they vary by their pale blue to dark grey-blue coat. They are nocturnal animals and they do not enter the shore before dusk and leave the shore before dawn. They would usually forage during the day. Their nests are foud in burrows, under trees, in rock crevices and in caves. They will usually stay in small groups, roughly 10 birds or they will be found alone. The penguins will tend to stay close to the coast and will not tend to swim too far away. When it is not during breeding season, the penguins would sometimes take long trips at sea but will regularly return to the colony throughout the year.</p>

	<p>The breeding season varies from place to place and sometimes, it will vary from year to year. It depends greatly on the area that the penguins are currently living. It would typically start in August to September and the chicks tend to hatch in November to December. There can be multiple rounds of chicks being hatched, the breeding season can extend up to May. Incubation lasts up to 36 days. They will remain as chicks for 18-38 days and will be fully grown after 7-8 weeks.The little penguins tend to shed their coat during the end of breeding season. Their diet is mainly fish, they would mainly feed on sardines and anchovies but they would also feed on krill and squid.</p>
