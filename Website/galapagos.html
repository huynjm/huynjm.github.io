	<p>Galapagos penguins are the only species that can reach the water of the northern hemisphere which is where the climate is warm and tropical. They are exclusively found on the Galapagos Islands, their larger colonies are found on Isabela and Fernandina Islands. They prefer to live around huge rocky shores where there are holes that they can use as shelter and as protection from the sunlight. They don't wander too far from their colony. They are rely greatly on their colony since they are relatively small and so they are well organized and coordinated when it comes to hunting in groups. The penguins are capable of diving to a depth of 26 feet. </p>

	<p>Since they live in quite a warm climate, they can sometimes overheat. To solve this problem, they would open their flippers such that it can radiate heat and the sea breeze can help cool their temperature. They live in a quiet environment and are capable of co-existing with the other species on the islands. The penguins feel on small fish such as anchovies, sardines and mullets. They can usually hunt from below in the water, they try not to swim too far out from the island due to the danger of sharks. The penguins mate for life. They usually reproduce from April to May and from Auguest to September. The females can lay two eggs and their nests are built within volcanic cavities. The chicks leave the nest 60 days after they've hatched and can feed themselves several months later. The decrease in food is the main reason why the penguins have become endangered.</p>
