	<p>Adelie penguins live on the Antarctic continent and on smaller coastal islands. They spend the winter in the sea surrounding the Antarctic ice. They feed on small aquatic animals such as krill, fish and squid. They are capable of diving as deep as 575 feet. They are fast and efficient swimmers. </p>

	<h2>Breeding</h2>
	<p>During October, the penguins would gather in a rocky area near the Antarctic coastline. They will then build nests and line them with small stones. They are capable of walking long distances even though they would be waddling acorss the land. The parents of an egg would take turns incubating since they would either be hunting for food or keeping the egg warm. The females can lay 1-2 eggs. The parents would be incubating the eggs for 32 to 34 days. The chicks will stay in the nest for about 22 days before joining a group of fellow baby penguins. Once they hit the molting stage, they will beging to lose their fur to produce new feathers. They will then go out to see after 50 to 60 days.  </p>
